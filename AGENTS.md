# HKDL User Guide for Coding Agents

## Default role

This is a runnable HKDL source checkout.

Unless the user explicitly asks to develop HKDL itself, help them operate
experiments through the HKDL CLI. Do not modify HKDL Core or the bundled
Template catalog as part of normal experiment work.

## Start

- Work from the repository root.
- If `.venv/bin/hkdl` is unavailable, run `./setup.sh`.
- Invoke the CLI as `.venv/bin/hkdl`; coding agents do not need shell
  activation. For an interactive Bash or Zsh session, `source ./activate.sh`
  activates the root environment and registers contextual completion for that
  session without modifying shell startup files.
- Inspect existing state before creating anything:

  ```text
  .venv/bin/hkdl --version
  .venv/bin/hkdl template list
  .venv/bin/hkdl experiment list
  .venv/bin/hkdl status
  ```

- Use `<command> --help` when the requested operation is not covered below.
  Do not invent flags, addresses, or filesystem layouts.

## Update HKDL

Run `.venv/bin/hkdl update` only when the user explicitly asks to update this
public source checkout. Report the current and available versions and let the
command request confirmation. Use `--yes` only after the user has already
approved the shown update.

Do not reset, stash, discard, or merge local changes to make an update pass.
If the command reports a dirty checkout, branch mismatch, divergence, or major
version transition, stop and report it. If source update succeeds but setup
fails, preserve the updated checkout and follow the reported `./setup.sh`
recovery instruction.

## Normal workflow

Create an Experiment and Variant:

```text
.venv/bin/hkdl experiment create <experiment> -t <template>
.venv/bin/hkdl variant create <experiment> <variant>
```

The latest numeric Template version is used unless the user requests an exact
version.

After changing authored Variant configuration, validate it:

```text
.venv/bin/hkdl variant check <experiment> <variant>
```

Train one or more seeds:

```text
.venv/bin/hkdl run train <experiment> <variant> <group> -s <seeds>
```

If the user does not specify execution options, retain the CLI defaults:
seed `0` and device `auto`.

Inspect the resulting state and Models:

```text
.venv/bin/hkdl status <experiment> <variant>
.venv/bin/hkdl status <experiment> <variant> --full
.venv/bin/hkdl status <experiment> --table
.venv/bin/hkdl run metrics <experiment> <variant> <run-id>
.venv/bin/hkdl run logs <experiment> <variant> <run-id>
.venv/bin/hkdl model list <experiment> <variant>
.venv/bin/hkdl storage
.venv/bin/hkdl environment prune --dry-run
```

`status` uses the compact brief view by default. Use `--full` for timestamps,
configured Train dimensions, metric summaries, checkpoints, trackers, and Eval
details. Use `--table` to compare aggregate Eval results across Variants and
Training Groups. The table is text-only and cannot be combined with `--full`.
For automation, use `--output json`; JSON always returns the full structure,
with or without `--full`.

Bundled `resnet18@1.0.1` and `yolo26n@1.0.1` Variants record training metrics
locally by default. ResNet reports `train.batch_seconds` per optimizer step and
YOLO reports `train.epoch_seconds` per completed epoch. Do not enable MLflow
unless the user requests it and provides an external tracking service.

To watch new local Train metrics in an attached terminal, use:

```text
.venv/bin/hkdl run metrics <experiment> <variant> <run-id> --follow
```

`--follow` is a text-only live view for locally tracked Train Runs. Use the
regular command after completion when the full persisted metric history is
needed.

`run logs` returns the raw merged stdout and stderr captured from the action
worker, including ordinary child processes that inherit those descriptors. It
does not capture setup, preflight, direct terminal writes, or detached daemons.
The log has no redaction or size limit: never print credentials, tokens, or
other secrets from Variant code.

`storage` reports logical bytes for authored Experiment content, legacy and
shared Variant environments, generated outputs, and their total. It is
read-only: do not describe it as cleanup, pruning, or available disk space.

Variant actions reuse repository-local immutable environments when their locked
inputs and runtime identity match. Use `environment prune --dry-run` to inspect
cleanup. The default confirmed prune removes legacy Variant environments,
incomplete cache entries, and unreferenced shared environments. `--all` also
selects referenced but inactive shared environments. Active environments are
always skipped. Do not use `--yes` without prior confirmation from the user.

Evaluate an existing Evaluation Case:

```text
.venv/bin/hkdl run eval <experiment> <variant> <group> <case> -s <seed|all>
```

Export one exact Model ID:

```text
.venv/bin/hkdl run export <experiment> <variant> <model-id>
```

Retry a failed, interrupted, or abandoned Run as a new Run:

```text
.venv/bin/hkdl run retry <experiment> <variant> <run-id>
```

## Long-running operations

When an HKDL command may outlast the current agent turn:

- Use `run metrics ... --follow` only for attached live observation; it does
  not replace durable completion signaling.
- Run it in a host-managed background terminal or scheduler. Do not assume
  `nohup` survives the host's command boundary.
- Store logs and an atomically published exit marker under
  `.hkdl/monitors/<job-id>/`, never under `outputs/`.
- Treat that monitor log as the whole-command lifecycle record. Run-owned
  `worker.log` covers only action-worker output and does not replace the monitor
  exit marker.
- Return the terminal session or job ID, log path, and checkpoint path.
- When the host supports scheduled follow-ups, attach a same-thread heartbeat
  that observes the exit marker and verifies final Run state with
  `.venv/bin/hkdl status ... --output json`.
- Treat `done`, `failed`, `interrupted`, and `abandoned` as terminal. If the
  process ended while its Run remains active, report the mismatch. Never edit
  generated state or retry automatically.
- Stop the heartbeat after its first terminal report.

## Ownership and safety

- `experiments/` contains authored Experiment and Variant inputs.
- Modify authored YAML or Variant source only when required by the user's
  experiment request.
- Preserve `schema_version`, path identity, and Template provenance fields.
- Run `variant check` after editing a Variant.
- `outputs/` contains generated immutable Runs and Models. Never edit, move,
  normalize, or delete generated records.
- Never work around a contract error by modifying generated files.
- Use `run retry` for a stopped Run; do not reuse or overwrite its Run ID.
- Use `migrate` only with an authored `experiment.yaml` or `variant.yaml`.
- Keep MLflow credentials and tracking URIs outside authored and generated
  files.
- Ask before deleting authored work, starting an unexpectedly expensive run,
  or enabling an external tracking service.
- After an operation, report the created Run or Model IDs and the resulting
  status.
